  <p> Kashmir is a band I loved the first time I saw them perform at Pepsi Battle of the Bands. They performed Hamesha by EP, and their arrangement was amazing. The stage presence that Vais Khan as lead guitarist brought was something I felt like I hadn't seen in a while. </P>
  <p> I feel like I am always surprised by Kashmir, by how well they construct their songs, and how well they perform these songs too. Throughout the battle of the bands they improved with every performance. It really shows how much effort and care they put into their songs. Bilal Ali has an amazing way with his words, and his lyrics are very strong.
    Their songs capture such an amazing atmosphere, and paint such an amazing picture. They really do the whole 'tell a story in a song' -thing EXCEPTIONALLY.
  </p>
  <p>I really dont know how to explain to you how cool the guys from Kashmir are. I feel like all of their songs are unique and standalone, and tell their each individual story.</p>
