              <p style="background-color: #051E17">'Lover boy' is SUCH a sweet song - its like the the gateway drug to getting completely hooked onto Phum Viphurit's music. The sway of his voice is incredibly charming, and, combined with the chord choices and the guitar riffs - really makes not only this song, but all of Viphurit's music a joy to listen to. </p>
                        <p style="background-color: #051E17">His lyrics are personal to him, and when he performs he demonstrates that with a sort of care/vulnerability? </p>
                        <p style="background-color: #051E17">
                I had the (unbelievable) luck of seeing Viphurit perform in Sheffield, and just entering into the venue was so surreal because it was filled with people smiling along with Phum himself - it was just so? Nice? The atmosphere was so good, everyone there had so much love for him, and he had fun with the audience too.</p>
                        <p style="background-color: #051E17">
                His personality really shines in his music, and that is an amazing accomplishment for any artist. </p>
